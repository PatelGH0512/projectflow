## Projectflow Overview

**Projectflow** is a modern project management platform designed for teams to plan, track, and deliver work efficiently. It features an intuitive UI with Kanban boards, timelines, task labels, team collaboration, and a responsive dark/light theme.

---

### Architecture

- **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit for state management.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express, REST API, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL (assumed), AWS S3 for file storage.
- **Authentication:** AWS Cognito via AWS Amplify.
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit Query for API data fetching and caching.

---

### Key Features

#### 1. **Task Boards (Kanban)**
- Drag & drop tasks between columns (statuses: To Do, Work In Progress, Under Review, Completed).
- Each task displays title, description, priority, assignee, attachments, and comments.
- Implemented in `BoardView`.

#### 2. **Timeline View**
- Visualizes project tasks and deadlines on a timeline.
- Switchable via tabs in `ProjectHeader`.

#### 3. **Table & List Views**
- Tabular and list representations of tasks for quick filtering and sorting.
- Accessible via the same tabbed interface.

#### 4. **Projects Management**
- Create, view, and manage multiple projects.
- Projects are listed in the collapsible sidebar (`Sidebar`).
- Project creation handled by `ModalNewProject`.

#### 5. **User & Team Management**
- Users and teams are managed via dedicated pages and API endpoints.
- Sidebar links to users and `/teams`.

#### 6. **Search**
- Full-text search across tasks, projects, and users.
- Implemented via the `/search` endpoint and UI.

#### 7. **Authentication**
- AWS Cognito handles user sign-up, sign-in, and session management.
- Integrated via AWS Amplify in `authProvider.tsx`.
- User details (profile picture, username) are fetched and displayed in the sidebar and other components.

#### 8. **Dark/Light Mode**
- Theme toggling is managed via Redux state and Tailwind CSS classes.

#### 9. **Responsive Design**
- Sidebar collapses on mobile, with a mobile footer for user info and sign out.

---

### Component Structure

- **Sidebar:** Navigation, project list, user info, sign out (`Sidebar`).
- **Header:** Page titles and action buttons (`Header`).
- **ProjectCard:** Displays project summary (`ProjectCard`).
- **ModalNewProject/ModalNewTask:** Forms for creating projects and tasks.
- **BoardView/ListView/TimelineView/TableView:** Different task visualization modes.
- **Redux State:** API slices for projects, tasks, users, teams (`api.ts`).

---

### Authentication Flow

1. **Sign Up/Sign In:**  
   Users authenticate via AWS Cognito, using Amplify‚Äôs UI components.
2. **Session Management:**  
   Amplify manages tokens and session state. Tokens are attached to API requests for authorization.
3. **User Data Fetching:**  
   After login, user details are fetched from the backend and displayed in the UI.
4. **Sign Out:**  
   Calls Amplify‚Äôs `signOut` method, clearing session and redirecting to login.

---

### How It Works

- **Frontend** sends API requests (with Cognito JWT tokens) to the backend for all CRUD operations.
- **Backend** validates tokens, interacts with the database via Prisma, and returns data.
- **State** is managed globally with Redux Toolkit, and UI updates reactively as data changes.
- **Files** (profile pictures, attachments) are stored on AWS S3 and referenced via URLs.

---

**In summary:**  
Projectflow is a full-stack, cloud-enabled project management tool with modern UX, real-time collaboration, and robust authentication, built for teams to manage projects efficiently.
